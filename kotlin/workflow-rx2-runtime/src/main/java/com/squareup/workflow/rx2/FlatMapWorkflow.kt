/**
 * Given a stream of [InputT] values to use as inputs for the top-level [workflow], returns a
 * [Flowable] that, when subscribed to, will start [workflow] and emit its [Update]s. When the
 * subscription is disposed, the workflow will be terminated.
 *
 * The returned [Flowable] is _not_ multicasted â€“ **every subscription will start a new workflow
 * session.** It is recommended to use a multicasting operator on the resulting stream, such as
 * [Flowable.replay], to share the updates from a single workflow session.
 *
 * The workflow's logic will run in whatever threading context the source [Flowable] is being
 * observed on.
 *
 * This operator is an alternative to using
 * [WorkflowHost.Factory][com.squareup.workflow.WorkflowHost.Factory] that is more convenient to
 * use with a stream of inputs.
 *
 * This function operates on [Flowable] instead of [Observable] because the workflow runtime
 * inherently supports backpressure. [Flowable] supports backpressure, [Observable] does not.
 * RxJava provides operators to adapt between [Flowable]s and [Observable]s by explicitly specifying
 * how to use backpressure. By operating on [Flowable], this operator leaves it up to the caller to
 * specify strategies for handling backpressure, instead of assuming any particular behavior.
